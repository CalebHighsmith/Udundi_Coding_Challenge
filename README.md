# Udundi_Coding_Challenge
Thank you so much again for giving me the chance to recreate your mock up site. This was a ton of fun!
The overall amount of time was 10 hours from start to finish. I ended up splitting the project into two parts, one for each day.
The first day was spent writing a lot of the html and css needed to get the site to look the same and, at this stage, added zero 
functionality to the website.
Once I had the site the way I wanted it to look, the next day was spent adding creative animations and dealing with the hidden div that
pops up once "more details" is clicked. This was ultimately accomplished by using a few lines of jQuery and the usage of the .toggle 
function.
The rest of the time was spent cleaning up the code, adding comments where there were not any and, testing the site over and over again.
Anyway, I hope you guys enjoy my work on this and again, thank you for your time I know this whole process must be extremely tedious and
exhausting. Also, I hope you like the lyrcis I included as a text place-holder in the hidden document! - Caleb H.
